Usage: ./keysynth <soundfont file> <part of keyboard alsa port name>
Example: ./keysynth WST25FStein_00Sep22.SF2 "Keystation 61es"

To list all available port names just run keysynth without arguments. You can
type only part of port name to match. For example if full name is "USB Keystation 61es MIDI 1"
it's enought to simply type "Keystation".
